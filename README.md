# Financisto 1.6.8 Holo

Please see https://github.com/dsolonenko/financisto for latest development by 
orginal author.

This codebase is started from an imported copy of an old version of source code 
at launchpad (https://code.launchpad.net/~financisto-dev/financisto/trunk), as 
an working interim version until proper version 2 comes out.

I haven't modified package name yet, so you'll need to remove Play store version 
first, to be able to install this version.

BE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR DATA!

* Holo theme
* Fixed date/time pickers
* Tweaked text layout, support device text scaling
* Search memo text
* Location removed due to huge change in google maps API
* Backup file compatible with Play store version 1.7.1
* Dropbox sync works, but you need to supply your own appid/key
