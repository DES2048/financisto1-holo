<h2>Notification Template</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#payee">Payee extraction</a></li>
	<li><a href="#note">Filling transaction note</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
	After you grant Financisto Holo permission to read notifications, it can match notifications
	against rules you defined and create transactions from them, obtaining transaction info from
	notifications with patterns. Any app generating notification can be used to trigger transaction
	creation, including SMS messages, bank app push notifications, or even instant messaging app
	receiving messages (so you can send message to yourself from another phone to log transaction,
	perhaps you have an iPhone and prefer to carry it going out for example).
</p>

<p>
There's a new button on top-right of SMS/Notification tmeplate list screen that
displays current notifications visible to the app. Make a transaction / wait for 
next time you make a purchase, and then open this screen. The colored line is 
the notification title, or Sender, as seen by the app. Click one of it will copy
its sender and content to clipboard so you can paste to template screen and edit.
</p>

<p>
Now we can fill in the template. The color part is sender, the body part don't 
need to contain entire message, only need to cover relevant parts. 
Click <b>(?)</b> to see available placeholders that will extract info from the 
message, or here's the list:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>{{a}}</b> - the code part that will used to lookup account</li>
	<li><b>{{e}}</b> - payee name to lookup from database</li>
	<li><b>{{p}}</b> - the amount/price numeric part</li>
	<li><b>{{t}}</b> - text part to extract as transaction note, this one is "non-greedy", i.e. it will try to match as short as possible</li>
	<li><b>{{u}}</b> - text part to extract as transaction note, "greedy" (as long as possible)</li>
	<li><b>{{*}}</b> - anything irrelevant, i.e. if you want to skip a part of message that's dynamic but unused</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you want to choose account from notification content, you need to fill the
	"Card Number" field. It's typically the last 4 digits of card number, but your
	situation may different. Fill the value that will appear in the message.
</p>

<p>
	If there are multiple cards belong to the same account, just fill every one of it
	separate by comma or space.
</p>

<p>
After you make the template, you can paste the original notification body to see 
how it extracts the data.
</p>

<p>
Save it. Next time you received a notification, hopefully it'll trigger 
the template and create a transaction for you!

<h2 id="payee">Payee extraction</h2>

<p>
	You can use <b>{{e}}</b> in the template to mark a section as payee name, and the app will
	look up from database when creating transaction. If it found a payee entry with matching name,
	it will fill transaction's payee with that, and set transaction's category as the last used
	category of that payee.
</p>

<p>
	If template has selected a category, it will be always used instead of payee's last used category.
</p>

<h2 id="note">Filling transaction note</h2>

<p>
	You can define note to be filled into transaction in template. The logic that transactions
	created from templates get note are:<br />
</p>

<ol>
	<li>custom note defined in template, with text extracted from notification with <b>{{t}}</b> or <b>{{u}}</b>.</li>
	<li>(when template's note is empty) text extracted from notification, if available</li>
	<li>(when note is empty and no extraction defined) full notification body, if enabled in config</li>
</ol>
