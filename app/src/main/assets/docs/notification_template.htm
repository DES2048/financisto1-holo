If you want to choose account from notification content, you need to fill the 
"Card Number" field. It's typically the last 4 digits of card number, but your
situation may different. Fill the value that will appear in the message.
</p>

<p>
If there are multiple cards belong to the same account, just fill every one of it 
separate by comma or space.

There's a new button on top-right of SMS/Notification tmeplate list screen that
displays current notifications visible to the app. Make a transaction / wait for 
next time you make a purchase, and then open this screen. The colored line is 
the notification title, or Sender, as seen by the app. Click one of it will copy
its sender and content to clipboard so you can paste to template screen and edit.

<p>
Now we can fill in the template. The color part is sender, the body part don't 
need to contain entire message, only need to cover relevant parts. 
Click <b>(?)</b> to see available placeholders that will extract info from the 
message, or here's the list:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>{{a}}</b> - the code part that will used to lookup account</li>
	<li><b>{{p}}</b> - the amount/price numeric part</li>
	<li><b>{{t}}</b> - text part to extract as transaction note, this one is "non-greedy", i.e. it will try to match as short as possible</li>
	<li><b>{{u}}</b> - text part to extract as transaction note, "greedy" (as long as possible)</li>
	<li><b>{{*}}</b> - anything irrelevant, i.e. if you want to skip a part of message that's dynamic but unused</li>
</ul>

<p>
After you make the template, you can paste the original notification body to see 
how it extracts the data.
</p>

<p>
Save it. Next time you received a notification, hopefully it'll trigger 
the template and create a transaction for you!
<p>

<p>
(And yes, it's not limited to SMS or bank applications. You can create "commands" 
that you can send to yourself via instant message apps like this ...)
